Business Case: Predicting Online Purchase Intent

Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for a data science business case focused on predicting online purchasing intent using session-level behavioural data, supplemented with a macro level retail demand indicator.

The project is framed as a hypothetical consulting engagement, where the objective is to develop an interpretable predictive model that can support evidence based decision making in a digital retail context.

The workflow covers data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, visualisation, and basic pipeline testing to ensure reproducibility and robustness.
